# Food Order Calculator CLI

The Food Order Calculator CLI is designed to resolve an issue which I personally encounter almost every other day. 
Having to calculate manually and fairly how much each person on an order is very tedious. Below is an example order and split.

|:------|------:|-----:|------------:|-----:|------:|
|Paulene|$ 11.98|$ 0.84|$        0.75|$ 2.04|$ 15.61|
|Aaron  |$  8.99|$ 0.63|$        0.56|$ 1.53|$ 11.71|
